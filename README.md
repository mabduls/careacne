    npm run serve
    ```

## 🧠 How It Works

AcureScan uses a trained machine learning model to:

1. **Detect** acne presence in user-uploaded facial images
2. **Classify** detected acne into different types (e.g., papules, pustules, nodules, cysts)
3. **Analyze** severity and distribution patterns
4. **Recommend** appropriate treatments based on acne type and severity
5. **Provide** personalized skincare routines and treatment instructions

## 👨‍💻 Development Workflow

The application is built using custom Web Components for modularity:

- Each page is a self-contained component
- Components follow the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern with separate:
    - `-page.js` files for component definition (View)
    - `-presenter.js` files for business logic (Presenter)
- Routing is handled via hash-based navigation
- Data persistence uses IndexedDB through the idb library

## 📱 Progressive Web App Features

AcureScan is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with:

- Service Worker for offline capabilities
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Installable on compatible devices
- Fast loading and smooth performance

## 🔒 Privacy and Data Handling

- All facial analysis is performed locally on the user's device
- Image data is not stored permanently unless explicitly saved by the user
- User preferences and history are stored securely in the browser's local storage
